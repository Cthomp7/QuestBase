    "description": "Trapped deep beneath the mines after a violent collapse, the party must navigate an uncharted labyrinth while evading patrolling geth and uncovering the truth behind a mysterious shipment.",
    "recap": "Since last we left off, our party had ventured into the mines to not only start their shift, but to question the arrival of a mysterious shipment. As they were doing so, the geth arrived and began converting and attacking the defenseless miners. While the geth and their growing number of husks are continuing to patrol the mines our group has stumbled into a spectre who also seems to be doing the same. Being fired upon, the group has fallen victim to a mine collapse, and have found themselves lost in a section of the mine not yet explored some 60 feet below. Armed with a Ground penetrating scanner and Golorbiums lifeform analyzer, our party must work together to escape their predicament."
