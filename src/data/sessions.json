    "description": "The party uncovered signs of sabotage on the station, turned its defenses against the Geth, and discovered the murdered administrator as the Alliance fleet awaited their command.",
    "recap": "As the party wrapped up their fight with the Heretic Prime, they were thrown into yet another trap set by Saren. With the physical bombs a trap, the real explosion came from Heretic Prime itself. The explosion ripped through the space station, knocking Korpal and Tardie unconscious and sending the rest of our party flying. Despite losing THOR to the vacuum of space, our core party returned unscathed. Heading to Eden Prime, they collected Karbaxs' son and also met a survivor from the biotics school. After their interaction, they returned to the dreadnaught for debrief. There was an award ceremony, medals were passed out, and the council was present. For some, this was a harrowing experience."

    "description": "After accepting the surrender of sentient Geth, the party battled station-wide threats, confronted a Hanar saboteur, and witnessed Saren and Sovereign’s escape.",
    "recap": "The session begins with the surrender of two Geth who had gained sentience. It would seem that they have lost their connection to sovereign, and have come to their own conclusions. Wary, the party accepted their surrender, and left them to stay under the guard of the Alliance Navy. In the meantime, the Alliance fleet was called in, and the fight broke out across the stations interior and exterior. The party rushed up the elevator, and spots the Hanar saboteur on the station. Despite their efforts, another life was claimed before Xenas was subdued. The party join the rest of the marines, and charge into battle. As they enter the room with multiple explosives, Saren and Sovereign both escape the system, likely with something found in tow."

    "description": "Surviving a devastating explosion triggered by Heretic Prime, the party regrouped on Eden Prime before receiving medals in a somber award ceremony aboard the dreadnaught.",
    "recap": "The party started the session by witnessing Lazarus be sucked into pocket dimensional space by Glitch, before disappearing completely. One of the LOKI units seems to have gained sentience, and joined the party in his place. While investigating the stations administration rooms, they discovered the presence of potential sabotage on the station. After, the party engaged with a disorganized Geth defense, they were able to defeat those guarding the station defenses. Suprisingly, some surrended, pending questioning by the party. Before the session ended, the station defenses were turned on the geth thanks to the parties efforts, and some massive rolls allowed the party to severely diminish the Geth fleet. Korpal also discovered the Stations Administrative heads office, and found the body of the Administrator pierced by a strange needle laced with a neurotoxin. The System Alliance fleet awaits the parties command to engage."

    "description": "The party rigs the school with explosives, successfully taunts Saren into a trap, and prepares for the explosive showdown.",
    "recap": "The party searches the school up and down, and find a number of useful things within. They prepare traps, and an eventual trick against Saren. Rigging the school to explode by an air strike, Korpal taunts Saren and is successful in trapping him. This did however come at a cost, as the children were left to fend for themselves. At least two were killed in action, the rest of the field trip is considered MIA. The party drives a school bus and is loosely chased by Geth dropships as most of them were successfully brought down by the explosion. Presumably a bus driver in their former life, Golorbium expertly lands the craft near the Space Elevator. Employing the window of opportunity, the party boards the space elevator and sends themselves up into Oroborous. On their way out, they trigger a plasma storm to great effect, and the heavy Geth presence on Eden Prime seems neutralized. The session continues as the party board the Space Station. There, the party finds it crawling with Geth, the oxygen shut off. The session ends with a small fight, and an uncertainty towards the Geth response."
