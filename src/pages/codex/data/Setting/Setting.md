# Setting
![Setting](/src/assets/media/setting.jpg)

The Mass Effect universe is firmly in the genre of space opera. It takes place in the future and spans the entire Milky Way galaxy. Many standard sci-fi tropes are in full effect. The Citadel is the cultural and political center of the galaxy, and is located in the Serpent Nebula. The Citadel Council is the political body that controls galactic politics. Membership into the Council is limited to races that have proven to be able to handle responsibility for the rest of the galaxy. As of 2170, the Council is made of representatives from 3 races. Other races can petition the Council; the Citadel is home to the embassies of many races. Humans are the new kids on the block, having discovered Prothean ruins and archives and FTL on Mars in 2148 CE. FTL and other technologies are based around something called the ”mass effect”, which due to some handwavy science, gives things higher or lower mass. The mass effect is a property of something called Element Zero that when subjected to an electrical current releases dark energy that can be manipulated into mass effect fields . Some individuals have the ability to manipulate these mass effect fields. This is called biotics (both the individuals and the skill). Basically, this is space magic. The galaxy is connected via a portal network of giant structures known as mass relays. Mass relays are approximately indestructable, and basically slingshot ships from point-to-point at huge FTL speeds. Travel in-system is done by a less-awesome FTL drive in the ship.
