# Mass Effect Relays
Mass Relays are mass transit devices scattered across the Milky Way, usually located within certain star systems. They form an enormous galaxy-wide network enabling rapid interstellar travel. Hailed as one of the greatest achievements of the now extinct Protheans, a mass relay can transport starships instantaneously to another relay within the network, allowing journeys that would otherwise take years or even centuries with only FTL drives to occur in only a handful of days, or even hours.
