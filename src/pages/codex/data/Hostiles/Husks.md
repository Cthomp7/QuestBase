# Husks
![Husks](../../src/assets/media/husk.png)

When a target person is captured, they are placed on impaling devices, huge spikes that Alliance marines have nicknamed "dragon's teeth". Over time the body's organs, skin, and water content are converted into cybernetic materials; blood is changed to a sickly green fluid, and the body generates an electrical charge.

When the spikes are approached — say, if marines try to recover their dead comrades — the husks are released and attack.

Fully-converted husks do not retain any vestiges of their former personalities.
