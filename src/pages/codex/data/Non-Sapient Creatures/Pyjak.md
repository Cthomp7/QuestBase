# Pyjaks

Pyjaks, sometimes referred to as "space monkeys", are a primitive species found on several planets including Eletania, Tuchanka, and Zorya.

The fact that they are able to thrive in such varied ecosystems suggests a very high ability to adapt. They live in small colonies of rough shelters, and appear to do little more than wander around in groups. They are apparently a somewhat curious species, and have been known to scavenge pieces of technology.

The krogan of Tuchanka view space monkeys as an invasive nuisance, so much so that they may insult other beings by calling them pyjaks. The creatures have been spotted clinging to tree branches, sticking out their finely-pointed tongues, suggesting that they eat small insects and grubs from the crevices in tree bark Pyjaks were brought to Tuchanka by a trader who had visited Eletania. Several pyjaks stowed aboard the trader's ship and then swarmed out when the trader landed on Tuchanka, stealing things and defecating everywhere. When the leader of Clan Forsan was hit with pyjak dung, the trader responsible for their presence was executed.
