# Space Cow

Space Cows are orange-and-white herbivores with orange irises, four legs, and two small arm-like forelimbs with two fingers each.

Space Cows naturally graze in herds. There are wild herds on Chasca, Nodacrux and Ontarom, as well as on Aite.

Space Cows are edible by humans. Overcooked Space Cow tongue is incredibly tough.

These creatures can be talked to, but they don't talk back. Space Cows aren't startled by gunfire, vehicle ramming, or anything else. Killing them for whatever reason does not even elicit any reaction from their herdmates, but it may draw notice from the Galactic Humane Society should they learn of it as "animals are people too" in their view. Strangely, some farmers refuse to care for these animals due to their shifty nature, citing credits going "missing" whilst in their care.
