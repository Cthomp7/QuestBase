# Varren

Varren are omnivores with a preference for living prey. Originally native to the krogan homeworld of Tuchanka, they are, like most life from Tuchanka, savage, clannish, and consummate survivors. They are pack hunters when vulnerable prey is readily available and become scavengers when outnumbered or outclassed.

Their supreme adaptability, vicious demeanor, and rapid breeding cycle have made them ubiquitous and dangerous pests on many worlds. Virtually everywhere the krogan have been, varren infestations have followed, wreaking havoc with the native ecology. Apparently varren are so vicious they'll even take on the geth.

The krogan have had a love-hate relationship with varren for millennia, alternately fighting them for territory and embracing them as treasured companions. To this day, krogan raise them as beasts of war. A common subgenus of varren has metallic silver scales, leading to the rather unusual nickname 'fishdogs'. Varren are a popular food source, as advertisements of a "Fishdog Food Shack," which serves varren skewers as well as varren steaks on Illium.

Varren pit fights aren't the only sport these creatures compete in; they can also be trained to race against other varren for their owners' amusement and profit. Professional varren racers eat a special diet based on what they get in the wild, minus radioactive contaminants, and are forbidden to eat body parts of sapient races like krogan. Races are less violent than pit fights, although on occasion varren do try to subdue each other by biting throats without actually piercing skin. There are, however, incidents where races do devolve into fights that end up with mutilated varren.
