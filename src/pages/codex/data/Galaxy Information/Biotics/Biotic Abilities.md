# Biotic Abilities
In Mass Effect, biotics are terrifyingly powerful, in some cases able to toss entire roomfuls of enemies in the air with a single ability use, or take even the largest and most dangerous enemy types totally out of a fight. Enemy biotics are almost as threatening to Shepard's squad in return, as biotic users can appear in groups in several missions and are capable of ragdolling the squad and in some cases almost permanently rendering it helpless. When disabled and ragdolled by biotics, the player isn't even able to access the game menu.

In Mass Effect, both enemies, allies, and the player can have biotic resistance that reduces the damage, duration, and effectiveness of biotic abilities. Some enemies are immune to the effects of some biotic talents, either due to the talent not being high enough level, or because of a total immunity regardless of level. Advanced models of biotic amps can be equipped by certain classes to further enhance biotic prowess.
