# Alien Biotics
Biotic abilities are of varying rarity and status in other species:

### Asari
All asari are naturally biotic to some degree, though not all choose to develop their abilities. Those who do pursue training usually display formidable ability. They do not require implants to use biotics effectively, nor do they need to undergo special training to acquire conscious neural control; their reproductive physiology grants them this ability from birth. Biotic ability is mandatory for asari who want to go into military service. The most powerful train as asari commandos.
### Batarians
There are some known batarian biotics who are trained as shock troopers and sentinels. Many batarian favor heavy weaponry over delicate meditation
### Drell
The drell act as adepts and vanguards. Their alliance to the Hanar have allowed them to become powerful assassins, further augmented by their skill with biotics. They are a force to be reckloned with.

### Krogan
Krogan biotics are few in number, but all are extremely powerful and often train to become Krogan Battlemasters.. Before the genophage, biotic krogan who enlisted in the military would rise quickly through the ranks; the other soldiers were in fear and awe of them, so their superiors recognized they would command great respect as officers and promoted them. The krogan developed a surgical procedure that was able to confer biotic ability, but the operation had a high mortality rate, so it was discontinued following the release of the genophage.

### Protheans
it is unknown how widespread Prothean biotics were before their extinction.

### Quarians
Quarian biotics are very rare. It is speculated that this is due to their life aboard the Migrant Fleet. Element zero is such a rare resource that it is probably too precious to be "spent" on encouraging biotic potential in quarians, and because the quarians live aboard ships, any engine accident severe enough to release dust-form element zero would also be fatal to the crew, and any expectant mother would only be exposed to the dust if they had a compromised environmental suit.

### Rachni
Rachni Brood Warriors appear to have some biotic abilities.

### Salarians
Salarian biotics are unusual and highly prized. The salarian military does not risk them in the front lines but instead uses them in intelligence services.

### Turians
Turian biotics are also uncommon, and generally not much more powerful than a human L3. They are viewed with suspicion by the general turian infantry and tend to be relegated to special units called Cabals, which are employed for key missions.

### Volus
Some volus are trained as Adepts, Vanguards and Sentinels, although the Sentinels do not use biotic abilities. Unsuprisingly, the Volus have been known to use their planets abundance for Eezo as a unique bargaining chip. A highly illegal yet sought after black market serum has been used to induce biotic sensitivity.

### Vorcha
Some vorcha are trained as Sentinels. Early studies have shown little biotic capability in this race, likely due to their fixation on internal conflict.

### Others
To date, there has been no mention of the biotic abilities of the hanar, elcor, yahg or what role (if any) biotics play in their respective societies.

### Non-Sapient Biotics
Some non-sapient creatures have been known to develop biotic abilities. The amount of element zero in Thessia's environment has given rise to many species beyond the asari that display biotic abilities. These include both native species such as the manal as well as non-native species such as varren. Biotic abilities in varren make them short-tempered, often leading to their abuse and abandonment.A similar situation has occurred on Eingana, where eezo contamination from derelict warships caused many native animal species to develop biotic powers.
