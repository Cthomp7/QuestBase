Omni-gel is a technological material with a wide variety of applications. Omni-gel is composed of common, reusable industrial plastics, ceramics, and light alloys kept in a semi-molten state. It can be obtained by looting or scavenging it; by purchasing it from stores and vendors; and, most usefully, by synthesizing it through a process that breaks down existing equipment and converts it into the gel. Rendering down non-essential or obsolete hardware into omni-gel allows it to remain useful while keeping weight and storage space requirements to a minimum.
