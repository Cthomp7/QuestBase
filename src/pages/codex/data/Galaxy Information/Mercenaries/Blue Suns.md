# Blue Suns

The Blue Suns are a "private security organization," in reality a mercenary outfit, operating in the Skyllian Verge. The Blue Suns have a reputation for being both discreet and ruthlessly efficient, and as such charge a sizable fee.

Blue Suns mercenaries often have a tattoo of a blue sun somewhere on their body. During high-risk jobs, the tattoo would be removed with an acid wash to prevent them being identified, then reapplied once the job was finished.

Blue Suns consist mostly of batarians, turians, and humans. They are also known to employ mechanized support on occasion: YMIR, FENRIS, and LOKI Mechs.

# Overview
The Blue Suns were founded by Zaeed Massani and Vido Santiago in 2160 CE. Zaeed led the men while Vido did the administrative duties. Disagreement between the two over the inclusion of batarians on their ranks led to a power struggle by 2165 CE, resulting in Vido taking sole control and Zaeed's near-lethal expulsion from the group.

After betraying Zaeed, Vido hired as many batarians as he wanted, even naming Solem Dal'Serah his head of operations while relegating himself to the position of "Co-Executive Officer". This act was little more than a PR stunt: it was calculated as a sign of cooperation to placate his batarian benefactors and to draw away fire from potential assassination attempts.

It worked on both counts and the partnership lasts to the present day. Solem is known to the general public as the Blue Suns founder and leader while only a handful of trusted mercs even know who Vido is, let alone his old partner Zaeed.

Over the years the Suns grew into a fearsome combat force spanning dozens of systems.
