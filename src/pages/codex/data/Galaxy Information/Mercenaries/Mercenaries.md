Mercenaries are individuals that operate anywhere as long as there's profit to be had. They are usually hired by criminal organisations that require "heavy muscle", or by individuals who want protection or assassination services. Sometimes euphemistically referring to themselves as "private security organisations", mercenaries will commonly raid remote outposts or unprotected starships when unemployed.

Mercenaries hail from all races and backgrounds, though are most commonly turians, humans, batarians, or krogan. Given that their occupation requires them to be efficient and capable, mercenaries tend to use superior weapons and armor, meaning their equipment is usually produced by a variety of manufacturers (unlike military forces, which prefer to select equipment from a single company). Mercenaries are usually found at their bases on remote worlds, or protecting their employer's investments or operations.
