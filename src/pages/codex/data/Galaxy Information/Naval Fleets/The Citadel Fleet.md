# The Citadel Fleet

![Campaign Image](/media/the-citadel-fleet.webp)

The Citadel Fleet is the main space defense force of the Citadel. The flagship of the fleet is the asari dreadnought Destiny Ascension, the most powerful ship of the Council races. The Citadel Fleet consists of a mixed group of turian, salarian, and asari vessels, though the greater number of them are turian, due to the turians' peacekeeping role.

The exact number of ships in the Council's fleet is unknown, but there were enough vessels to patrol every mass relay linking Citadel space to the Terminus Systems and still leave a force stationed to protect the Citadel. Earth Ambassadors claimed that the Citadel Fleet was large enough to secure the entire Attican Traverse if the Council wished.
