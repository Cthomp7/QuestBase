# The Batarians
![The Batarians](/src/assets/media/batarians.png)

Four-eyed bipedal race. They are rather disreputable species, because their government is isolationist and paranoid to the point that anyone who leaves their territory is an outlaw. The ones the galaxy sees are pirates, slavers, and other such individuals. Hostilities peaked with the Skyllian Blitz of 2176, an attack on the human capital of Elysium by batarian-funded pirates and slavers. In 2178, the Alliance retaliated with a crushing assault on the moon of Torfan, long used as a staging base by batarian-backed criminals. In the aftermath, the batarians retreated into their own systems, and are now rarely seen in Citadel space.
