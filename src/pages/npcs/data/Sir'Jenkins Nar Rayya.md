# Sir'Jenkins nar Rayya: Engineer : ACTIVE

Sir'Jenkins nar Rayya: Part of the support crew, she was hired during her pilgrimage with the flotilla. She’s working with the company as an intern, and is trying to gain experience to eventually join a permanent ship crew. She has dreams of becoming a pilot, but it hasn’t been such a glamorous start as was hoped.

Since being rescued by the crew, she's taken time to repair the shuttle alongside Karbax. She's as eager as she is bright, and she looks forward to working with the team further.

She's proven to be very capable engineer.
