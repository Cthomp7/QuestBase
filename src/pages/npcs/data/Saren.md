# Saren: UNKNOWN
Saren Arterius, born 2139, is the longest serving turian member of the Spectres, the elite operatives answering directly to the Citadel Council. For 24 years, he has been an agent of the Council's will, a zealous defender of galactic stability in the unsettled border region of the Skyllian Verge.

Saren has recently been spotted working alongside the Geth. He seems very interested in the Prothean artifact currently in the parties possession.
